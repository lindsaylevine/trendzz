## Known issues

If you're having trouble seeing the bottom select row, you can either:

- Add the app to your homescreen and open it again, this will correctly show the full height (`100vh`).
- Try to drag up by pulling the visible part of the select row.

I think browsers should always show `100vh` regardless whether the user started scrolling down or not.
Firefox doesn't seem to have this issue. Chrome and Chromium based browsers do :/
